I looked into the Workflow API files for dev, QA, and prod. Hereâ€™s the summary:
Current state: 
Our current setup uses three separate main files (main-prod.py, main-qa.py, main.py) for different environments. This leads to significant code redundancy. The core logic for tasks and workflows - including models, database queries, and API endpoints - is largely duplicated across these files. The main differences are confined to the environment-specific configurations like the JWKS URLs and database connection strings.

Feasibility: 
we can create a single, unified main.py file. This new file will manage environment selection via an APP_ENV variable from a .env file. It will handle the initial setup, including database connections and authentication, dynamically based on the chosen environment. The existing, well-structured router files for each endpoint group (e.g., alltasks, metadata) can then be imported and registered in this central file.

Benefits: 
Reduced Code Duplication: We eliminate redundant code, making the project easier to maintain.
Simplified Management: We can manage all three environments from a single codebase.
Streamlined Deployment: We only need to de
